## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx)
- PHP installed (v7.x or higher)
- MySQL database (optional, if using a database to store books)

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Brownei/Bookstore.git
    ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   - Move to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd Bookstore
     ```

3. **Start up the web server**:
   - You just have to run 
        ```bash 
        php -S localhost:4000
        ```
    This command can be able to run the PHP server on port 4000 without the need of Apache servers.
    You can use Apache servers if needed to 
    N.B: This command runs on linux if you have downloaded the right package on your machine.
    ***WINDOWS USERS, SORRY YOU MAY NEED APACHE SERVERS, LOL!***

4. **Setting database**:
    - You will need mysql or postgres drivers on your machine to be able to have the project connect to the database. 
    On Linux:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install php-mysql
        sudo apt install php-pgsql
        ```
    - Sadly if you have the knowledge of Docker, Docker cannot connect to MySQL but it can on Postgres but MySQL was chosen for this project. So you can be able to download MySQL server on your local machine and set up everything to make sure it is working well. 
        ```bash
        # Downloads mysql server on laptop
        sudo apt install mysql-server 

        # Login into the mysql server
        mysql -u root

        # Create database and setup the user you will use for your project
        CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
        CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydatabase.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
        USE mydatabase;
        ```
    - The previous method will make everything connect which you will be able to setup on the file **db.php**


6. **Access the website**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000` to view the bookstore app.
